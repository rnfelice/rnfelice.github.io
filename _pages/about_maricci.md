My research interests surround the craniofacial anatomy and its evolution, with a current focus on the wide gapes of snakes. I use 3D geometric morphometrics (Felice Lab, UCL) to analyse lower jaw shapes across Serpentes to determine the ecological factors which drive jaw trait differences. I also use immunohistochemical methods ([Tucker Lab, KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/tucker-lab-fodocs)) to investigate the snake mandible during embryonic development to identify the biological mechanisms involved in shaping its distinctive form. Using this interdisciplinary approach, I aim to garner a better understanding of the complex development and evolutionary history of the mandible.
