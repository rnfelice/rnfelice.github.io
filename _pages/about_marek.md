##### Research Tech
I'm an evolutionary biologist and palaentologist hailing from Stoke-on-Trent in the UK. I use a multifaceted approach that combines 3D shape analysis with phylogenetic comparative methods and functional morphology to understand the evolution of form and function of the vertebrate skeleton across time and clades. I'm passionate about my science and about making it inclusive for everyone. The vertebral column is the defining feature of vertebrates, supporting the entire skeleton of over 50,000 species, so I've made it the defining feature of my career. My current focus is on the evolution of the neck in birds and dinosaurs. I'm currently working as a research technician within the lab, aiding other lab members on investigating the evolution of the avian and mammalian brain.
