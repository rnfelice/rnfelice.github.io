My interests are centred around the impacts of different organism-level traits and processes at the micrevolutionary scale on macroevolutionary outcomes. I am especially interested in mutual interactions between development and patterns of integration in the tetrapod skull as recorded within the fossil record. Following this theme, my PhD research investigates how different life history strategies and patterns of integration have shaped dinosaur skull evolution.
