## Kat Gregory
My research interests focus on using multivariate methods to take a more holistic approach in order to understand evolution across time. Particularly, focusing on 3D Morphometrics, Phylogenetics, and Biogeography and how they interact, in order to parse the story of evolution and biodiversity across the tree of life. My PhD focuses on a 3D morphometric analysis of Bird crania and brains, particularly an intra-specific analysis within domestic chickens, and an inter-specific analysis of Darwin's finches.
