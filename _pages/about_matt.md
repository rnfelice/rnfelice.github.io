My main areas of interest are evolution, conservation and the crossover between them. My PhD centres on the effects of long-term captivity on extinct-in-the-wild species, with a focus on morphological, genetic and behavioural changes that may result from adaptation to captivity or reduced selection pressures. I aim to determine how these effects may impact a species’ recovery potential.
