## PhD Studentships
I am always open to discussing opportunities for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in my lab. I supervise students on the [BBSRC LIDo DTP](https://www.lido-dtp.ac.uk">) and [NERC TREES DLA](https://www.trees-dla.ac.uk) programs.

## Diversity
In the Felice Lab, we acknowledge that Science, Technology, Engineer and Math (STEM) fields have long lacked diversity due to a long history of exclusion. In an effort to combat these inequalities, we encourage people from underrepresented backgrounds to apply for any of the positions listed about. Ryan Felice is part of the [UCL Division of Biosciences Race Equity Committee](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/about/equality-diversity-and-inclusion/race-equity-committee), which has several ongoing projects to promote racial diversity and inclusion at UCL.
