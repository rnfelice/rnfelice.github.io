I’m a evolutionary biologist with focus on using phylogenetic comparative methods to understand the macroevolution of the vertebrate skeleton. I am particularly interested in geometric morphometrics, Bayesian evolutionary modelling, and understanding how trait covariation (e.g., modularity and integration) influences macroevolutionary tempo and mode.
