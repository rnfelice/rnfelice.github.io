I am an evolutionary biologist who is interested in the diversity of form and what causes things evolve the range of shapes and sizes that we see in nature. I use 3D shape analysis and comparative phylogenetic techniques to explore shape within and between species, and have worked on groups as diverse as fishes, dinosaurs, mammals, birds, reptiles and butterflies. I am especially interested in the role that sexual selection plays in evolution, and what effects it has on speciation, extinction and the generation of sexually selected traits such as horns, ornaments and other display structures. I am currently exploring the evolution of the brain in birds and mammals, and what role the contrasting functions of skull shape and jaw musculature play in constraining its size and shape.
