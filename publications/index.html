Reproductive success can also be particularly low in populations that are managed ex-situ. This can pose a challenge for threatened species recovery programmes because high reproductive success rates are often required to provide offspring for wild releases while ensuring population viability. Understanding the underlying causes of low reproductive success rates in ex-situ populations of threatened species is therefore essential so that management programmes can optimise species’ recovery potential. Here, we quantify rates of egg viability (i.e., indicating fertility and/or early embryo mortality) and total hatching success in the Extinct in the Wild sihek (Guam kingfisher, Todiramphus cinnamominus). Using Bayesian generalised linear mixed models, we investigate effects of parental age, parental inbreeding coefficient ( f), egg f and incubation method on egg viability and hatching success of viable eggs. We find that the sihek population has extremely low egg viability rates (~48% ± 2.15%, N = 304/635) and total egg-hatching success rates (~30% ± 1.82% SE 190/635) compared to other threatened and non-threatened bird species, both ex-situ and in the wild. We find that increased paternal age and f are key drivers of decreased egg viability. In contrast, increased maternal age and use of artificial incubation are important contributors to decreased egg-hatching success. Our results are particularly pertinent given current active recovery planning for sihek, which may require increased offspring production for wild releases. Furthermore, our results suggest that, in closed ex-situ populations where f inevitably increases across generations such that at a given time point older aged individuals may have lower f, there is a need for breeding recommendations to quantitively and systematically balance genetic considerations with species’ biological limitations such as reproductive senescence to meet recovery programme goals.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="hoffman_evolution_2025" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Evolution of growth strategy in alligators and caimans informed by osteohistology of the late Eocene early‐diverging alligatoroid crocodylian <em>Diplocynodon hantoniensis</em></p> </div> <div class="author"> D.

The fossil record of alligatoroids, however, reveals even greater diversity, including multiple examples of gigantism and a broader distribution that extends into polar latitudes. Osteohistological studies on extant alligatoroids show that living alligators and caimans both exhibit seasonal growth, with roughly comparable growth rates. However, alligators and caimans diverged from one another over 60 million years ago; the dearth of studies on extinct alligatoroids makes it unclear if the shared condition in extant taxa reflects convergent responses to rapid climatic changes in the recent past or represents the ancestral condition in alligatoroids. Additionally, sample sizes are often limited to one or two individuals, especially in extinct crocodylians, obscuring any intraspecific variation present. To address this uncertainty, we conducted the largest monospecific osteohistological study of an extinct crocodylian to date, based on a sample of nine femora, providing unique insight into the intraspecific variation in growth of the earlydiverging alligatoroid Diplocynodon hantoniensis from the late Eocene of the UK. The bone microanatomy of D. hantoniensis shows moderate compactness, with a welldefined medullary cavity, and osteohistological features that are generally consistent with those of extant alligatoroids. Samples vary greatly along a continuum in the degree of remodelling and vascularity, highlighting both the importance of evaluating intraspecific variation and limitations of basing histological assessments on singleton samples. Ontogenetic assessment indicates that our sample captures a range of skeletally immature to mature individuals, approximately corresponding to femoral size, but with notable exceptions possibly driven by sexual dimorphism. Body size estimates for D. hantoniensis (1.2–3.4 m) fall within the typical range of living American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). Reconstruction from cyclical growth marks indicates a similar overall growth rate between D. hantoniensis and A. mississippiensis. As in extant alligatoroids more generally, this is determinate, seasonally-controlled growth.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="basa_wide_2025" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>The wide gape of snakes: A comparison of the developing mandibular symphysis in sauropsids</p> </div> <div class="author"> Maricci Basa, Neal Anthwal, Ryan N.

One feature of the iconic wide gape of macrostomate (large-mouthed) snakes is due to changes in the rostral midline where the left and right hemi-mandible come together. Across vertebrates, the two sides of the lower jaw are held together by the mandibular symphysis. In snakes, the two halves of the lower jaw do not fuse and the symphysis remains free, facilitating gape expansion. The symphysis has previously been explored in lizards and crocodiles, where ligamentous fibres and cartilages span the joint. Here, we compared the anatomy of the forming ‘free’ mandibular symphysis in the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) to symphysis development in two lizards, the veiled chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus) and the ocelot gecko (Paroedura picta), and an outgroup sauropsid, the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). Microcomputed tomography imaging, whole-mount skeletal staining and histology staining confirmed the absence of bone and cartilage fusion at the mandibular symphysis in the corn snake during development, in contrast to the complete fusion of cartilage, but not bone, in both lizards and the fusion of the bone in the chick. Trichrome staining under circular polarised light and whole fast green staining highlighted that, while the symphyseal region was populated by a dense network of collagen fibres, the snake hemi-mandibles were not connected across the rostral region by this fibrous network. Instead, collagen fibres extended backwards and around the snake mental groove to an intermandibular nodule. This nodule attached to the midline dorsally, allowing integration of the movement of the soft and hard tissues. Our analysis highlights the adaptations required to allow extreme lower jaw mobility and independence of the two sides of the jaw as found in macrostomate snakes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="stevens_lower_2024" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Lower jaw modularity in the African clawed frog (<em>Xenopus laevis</em>) and fire salamander (<em>Salamandra salamandra gigliolii</em>)</p> </div> <div class="author"> Maddison Stevens, Anne-Claire Fabre, and Ryan N Felice </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>, Oct 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blad087" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Stevens%20et%20al_2023_Lower%20jaw%20modularity.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Abstract Modularity describes the degree to which the components of complex phenotypes vary semi-autonomously due to developmental, genetic and functional correlations. This is a key feature underlying the potential for evolvability, as it can allow individual components to respond to different selective pressures semi-independently. The vertebrate lower jaw has become a model anatomical system for understanding modularity, but to date most of this work has focused on the mandible of mammals and other amniotes. In contrast, modularity in the mandible of lissamphibians has been less well studied. Here, we used geometric morphometrics to quantify the static (intraspecific) modularity patterns in Xenopus laevis and Salamandra salamandra gigliolii. We tested developmental and functional hypotheses of modularity and demonstrate that both species exhibit significant modularity. Functional modularity was supported in both Xenopus and Salamandra. Allometry has a small yet significant impact on lower jaw shape in both taxa and sex has a significant effect on shape in Xenopus. The high lower jaw modularity in both species observed here, combined with the well-established modularity of the amphibian cranium, suggests that modularity is a ubiquitous feature of the tetrapod head.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="hunt_ecological_2023" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Ecological and life-history drivers of avian skull evolution</p> </div> <div class="author"> Eloise S E Hunt, Ryan N Felice, Joseph A Tobias, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Yet increasingly studies are questioning the strength of this correlation between feeding ecology and morphology in relation to the entire neornithine radiation, suggesting that other factors also significantly affect skull evolution. Here, we broaden this debate to assess the influence of a range of ecological and life-history factors, specifically habitat density, migration, and developmental mode, in shaping avian skull evolution. Using 3D geometric morphometric data to robustly quantify skull shape for 354 extant species spanning avian diversity, we fitted flexible phylogenetic regressions and estimated evolutionary rates for each of these factors across the full data set. The results support a highly significant relationship between skull shape and both habitat density and migration, but not developmental mode. We further found heterogenous rates of evolution between different character states within habitat density, migration, and developmental mode, with rapid skull evolution in species that occupy dense habitats, are migratory, or are precocial. These patterns demonstrate that diverse factors affect the tempo and mode of avian phenotypic evolution and that skull evolution in birds is not simply a reflection of feeding ecology.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="goswami_developmental_2023" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Developmental origin underlies evolutionary rate variation across the placental skull</p> </div> <div class="author"> Anjali Goswami, Eve Noirault, Ellen J.

This disparity has recently been studied from the perspective of the whole skull, but the skull is composed of numerous elements that have distinct developmental origins and varied functions. Here, we assess the evolution of the skull’s major skeletal elements, decomposed into 17 individual regions. Using a high-dimensional morphometric approach for a dataset of 322 living and extinct eutherians (placental mammals and their stem relatives), we quantify patterns of variation and estimate phylogenetic, allometric and ecological signal across the skull. We further compare rates of evolution across ecological categories and ordinal-level clades and reconstruct rates of evolution along lineages and through time to assess whether developmental origin or function discriminate the evolutionary trajectories of individual cranial elements. Our results demonstrate distinct macroevolutionary patterns across cranial elements that reflect the ecological adaptations of major clades. Elements derived from neural crest show the fastest rates of evolution, but ecological signal is equally pronounced in bones derived from neural crest and paraxial mesoderm, suggesting that developmental origin may influence evolutionary tempo, but not capacity for specialisation.

Comparisons of intraspecific and clade-wide patterns of phenotypic covariation could inform how population-level trends ultimately dictate macroevolutionary changes. However, most studies have focused on analyzing integration and modularity either at macroevolutionary or intraspecific levels, without a shared analytical framework unifying these temporal scales. In this study, we investigate the intraspecific patterns of cranial integration in two squamate species: Natrix helvetica and Anolis carolinensis. We analyze their cranial integration patterns using the same high-density three-dimensional geometric morphometric approach used in a prior squamate-wide evolutionary study. Our results indicate that Natrix and Anolis exhibit shared intraspecific cranial integration patterns, with some differences, including a more integrated rostrum in the latter. Notably, these differences in intraspecific patterns correspond to their respective interspecific patterns in snakes and lizards, with few exceptions. These results suggest that interspecific patterns of cranial integration reflect intraspecific patterns. Hence, our study suggests that the phenotypic associations that direct morphological variation within species extend across micro- and macroevolutionary levels, bridging these two scales.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="marek_neck_2023" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>The neck as a keystone structure in avian macroevolution and mosaicism</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ryan D.

One of the proposed key mechanisms that allowed birds to acquire flight and modify the associated anatomical structures into diverse forms is mosaic evolution, which describes the parcelization of phenotypic traits into separate modules that evolve with heterogeneous tempo and mode. Avian mosaicism has been investigated with a focus on the cranial and appendicular skeleton, and as such, we do not understand the role of the axial column in avian macroevolution. The long, flexible neck of extant birds lies between the cranial and pectoral modules and represents an opportunity to study the contribution of the axial skeleton to avian mosaicism. Results  Here, we use 3D geometric morphometrics in tandem with phylogenetic comparative methods to provide, to our knowledge, the first integrative analysis of avian neck evolution in context with the head and wing and to interrogate how the interactions between these anatomical systems have influenced macroevolutionary trends across a broad sample of extant birds. We find that the neck is integrated with both the head and the forelimb. These patterns of integration are variable across clades, and only specific ecological groups exhibit either head-neck or neckforelimb integration. Finally, we find that ecological groups that display head-neck and neck-forelimb integration tend to display significant shifts in the rate of neck morphological evolution. Conclusions  Combined, these results suggest that the interaction between trophic ecology and head-neck-forelimb mosaicism influences the evolutionary variance of the avian neck. By linking together the biomechanical functions of these distinct anatomical systems, the cervical vertebral column serves as a keystone structure in avian mosaicism and macroevolution.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="coombs_tempo_2022" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>The tempo of cetacean cranial evolution</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ellen J.

Many anatomical shifts in this transition involve the feeding, respiratory, and sensory structures of the cranium, which we quantiﬁed with a high-density, three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of 201 living and extinct cetacean species spanning the entirety of their 50-million-year evolutionary history. Our analyses demonstrate that cetacean suborders occupy distinct areas of cranial morphospace, with extinct, transitional taxa bridging the gap between archaeocetes (stem whales) and modern mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes (toothed whales). This diversity was obtained through three key periods of rapid evolution: ﬁrst, the initial evolution of archaeocetes in the early to mid-Eocene produced the highest evolutionary rates seen in cetaceans, concentrated in the maxilla, frontal, premaxilla, and nasal; second, the late Eocene divergence of the mysticetes and odontocetes drives a second peak in rates, with high rates and disparity sustained through the Oligocene; and third, the diversiﬁcation of odontocetes, particularly sperm whales, in the Miocene ( 18–10 Mya) propels a ﬁnal peak in the tempo of cetacean morphological evolution. Archaeocetes show the fastest evolutionary rates but the lowest disparity. Odontocetes exhibit the highest disparity, while mysticetes evolve at the slowest pace, particularly in the Neogene. Diet and echolocation have the strongest inﬂuence on cranial morphology, with habitat, size, dentition, and feeding method also signiﬁcant factors impacting shape, disparity, and the pace of cetacean cranial evolution.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="goswami_attenuated_2022" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Attenuated evolution of mammals through the Cenozoic</p> </div> <div class="author"> Anjali Goswami, Eve Noirault, Ellen J.

Yet, discrepancies between molecular divergence estimates and the fossil record fuel ongoing debate around the timing, tempo, and drivers of this radiation. Analysis of a three-dimensional skull dataset for living and extinct placental mammals demonstrates that evolutionary rates peak early and attenuate quickly. This long-term decline in tempo is punctuated by bursts of innovation that decreased in amplitude over the past 66 million years. Social, precocial, aquatic, and herbivorous species evolve fastest, especially whales, elephants, sirenians, and extinct ungulates. Slow rates in rodents and bats indicate dissociation of taxonomic and morphological diversification. Frustratingly, highly similar ancestral shape estimates for placental mammal superorders suggest that their earliest representatives may continue to elude unequivocal identification. , Becoming diverse Mammals have the greatest degree of morphological variation among vertebrate classes, ranging from giant whales to the tiny bumblebee bat. How they evolved this level of variation has been a persistent question, with much debate being centered around the timing and tempo of evolutionary change. Goswami et al . looked across a large dataset of extinct and extant mammalian skulls and found that the rate of evolutionary change peaked around the time of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and has general tapered off since then (see the Perspective by Santana and Grossnickle). Certain lifestyles, such as aquatic habitats or herbivory, led to faster change, whereas in some species such as rodents, morphological change appeared to be decoupled from taxonomic diversification., Short bursts of innovation have punctuated a long-term decline in the rate of placental mammal skull evolution over the past 66 million years.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="mitchell_cranial_2021" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Cranial integration in the ring-necked parakeet, <em>Psittacula krameri</em> (Psittaciformes: Psittaculidae)</p> </div> <div class="author"> Matthew J Mitchell, Anjali Goswami, and Ryan N Felice </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>, Mar 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blab032" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Mitchell%20et%20al_2021_Cranial%20integration%20in%20the%20ring-necked%20parakeet,%20Psittacula%20krameri.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Abstract The study of integration and modularity aims to describe the organization of components that make up organisms, and the evolutionary, developmental and functional relationships among them. Both have been studied at the interspecific (evolutionary) and intraspecific (phenotypic and ontogenetic) levels to different degrees across various clades. Although evolutionary modularity and integration are well-characterized across birds, knowledge of intraspecific patterns is lacking. Here, we use a high-density, three-dimensional geometric morphometric approach to investigate patterns of integration and modularity in Psittacula krameri, a highly successful invasive parrot species that exhibits the derived vertical palate and cranio-facial hinge of the Psittaciformes. Showing a pattern of nine distinct cranial modules, our results support findings from recent research that uses similar methods to investigate interspecific integration in birds. Allometry is not a significant influence on cranial shape variation within this species; however, within-module integration is significantly negatively correlated with disparity, with high variation concentrated in the weakly integrated rostrum, palate and vault modules. As previous studies have demonstrated differences in beak shape between invasive and native populations, variation in the weakly integrated palate and rostrum may have facilitated evolutionary change in these parts of the skull, contributing to the ring-necked parakeet’s success as an invasive species.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="felice_complex_2021" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Complex macroevolutionary dynamics underly the evolution of the crocodyliform skull</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ryan N.

However, this homogeneity represents just a fraction of the variation that once existed in the clade, which includes extinct herbivorous and marine forms with divergent skull structure and function. Here, we use high-dimensional three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to quantify whole-skull morphology across modern and fossil crocodyliforms to untangle the factors that shaped the macroevolutionary history and relatively low phenotypic variation of this clade through time. Evolutionary modelling demonstrates that the pace of crocodyliform cranial evolution is initially high, particularly in the extinct Notosuchia, but slows near the base of Neosuchia, with a late burst of rapid evolution in crown-group crocodiles. Surprisingly, modern crocodiles, especially Australian, southeast Asian, Indo-Pacific species, have high rates of evolution, despite exhibiting low variation. Thus, extant lineages are not in evolutionary stasis but rather have rapidly fluctuated within a limited region of morphospace, resulting in significant convergence. The structures related to jaw closing and bite force production (e.g. pterygoid flange and quadrate) are highly variable, reinforcing the importance of function in driving phenotypic variation. Together, these findings illustrate that the apparent conservativeness of crocodyliform skulls betrays unappreciated complexity in their macroevolutionary dynamics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="felice_decelerated_2020" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Decelerated dinosaur skull evolution with the origin of birds</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ryan N.

Although Neornithine (that is, crown group) birds also exhibit constraint on facial development8,9, they have comparatively diverse beak morphologies associated with a range of feeding and behavioural ecologies, in contrast to Mesozoic birds. Here we describe a crow-sized stem bird, Falcatakely forsterae gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Cretaceous epoch of Madagascar that possesses a long and deep rostrum, an expression of beak morphology that was previously unknown among Mesozoic birds and is superficially similar to that of a variety of crown-group birds (for example, toucans). The rostrum of Falcatakely is composed of an expansive edentulous maxilla and a small tooth-bearing premaxilla. Morphometric analyses of individual bony elements and three-dimensional rostrum shape reveal the development of a neornithine-like facial anatomy despite the retention of a maxilla–premaxilla organization that is similar to that of nonavialan theropods. The patterning and increased height of the rostrum in Falcatakely reveals a degree of developmental lability and increased morphological disparity that was previously unknown in early branching avialans. Expression of this phenotype (and presumed ecology) in a stem bird underscores that consolidation to the neornithine-like, premaxilla-dominated rostrum was not an evolutionary prerequisite for beak enlargement.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="watanabe_ecomorphological_2019" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Ecomorphological diversification in squamates from conserved pattern of cranial integration</p> </div> <div class="author"> Akinobu Watanabe, Anne-Claire Fabre, Ryan N.

The wealth of phenotypic information available from these datasets has the potential to inform our understanding of morphological variation and evolution. However, the ever-increasing ease of compiling 3D datasets has created an urgent need for sophisticated methods of capturing high-density shape data that reflect the biological complexity in form. Landmarks often do not take full advantage of the rich shape information available from high-resolution 3D specimen reconstructions, as they are typically restricted to sutures or processes that can be reliably identified across specimens and exclude most of the surficial morphology. The development of sliding and surface semilandmark techniques has greatly enhanced the quantification of shape, but their application to diverse datasets can be challenging, especially when dealing with the variable absence of some regions within a structure. Using comprehensive 3D datasets of crania that span the entire clades of birds, squamates and caecilians, we demonstrate methods for capturing morphology across incredibly diverse shapes. We detail many of the difficulties associated with applying semilandmarks to comparable regions across highly disparate structures, and provide solutions to some of these challenges, while considering the consequences of decisions one makes in applying these approaches. Finally, we analyse the benefits of high-density sliding semilandmark approaches over landmark-only studies for capturing shape across diverse organisms and discuss the promise of these approaches for the study of organismal form.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="felice_developmental_2018" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Developmental origins of mosaic evolution in the avian cranium</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ryan N.

This interpretation is based on a range of evidence, including observations of histology, phalangeal morphology, dentition, and taphonomy. However, many of these data are inconclusive or have been reinterpreted. Here we investigate whether the morphology of the axial skeleton in Ophiacodon displays specializations for aquatic locomotion. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of Ophiacodon to extant terrestrial and semi-aquatic tetrapods demonstrate that the distribution of centrum lengths in its vertebral column is similar in some ways to those of extant semi-aquatic reptiles. However, other basal synapsids that are widely regarded as terrestrial show comparable patterns, and the correlation between swimming style and vertebral morphology in extant semiaquatic tetrapods may be weaker than previously thought. Therefore, vertebral proportions provide little support for a semi-aquatic lifestyle in Ophiacodon. Given that most lines of evidence are equivocal at best, we suggest that future studies that consider the ecology of Ophiacodon use a terrestrial lifestyle as a null hypothesis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="adams_assessing_2014" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Assessing Trait Covariation and Morphological Integration on Phylogenies Using Evolutionary Covariance Matrices</p> </div> <div class="author"> Dean C.

Morphological covariation may be evaluated at various levels of biological organization, but when characterizing such patterns across species at the macroevolutionary level, phylogeny must be taken into account. We outline an analytical procedure based on the evolutionary covariance matrix that allows species-level patterns of morphological integration among structures defined by sets of traits to be evaluated while accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among taxa, providing a flexible and robust complement to related phylogenetic independent contrasts based approaches. Using computer simulations under a Brownian motion model we show that statistical tests based on the approach display appropriate Type I error rates and high statistical power for detecting known levels of integration, and these trends remain consistent for simulations using different numbers of species, and for simulations that differ in the number of trait dimensions. Thus, our procedure provides a useful means of testing hypotheses of morphological integration in a phylogenetic context. We illustrate the utility of this approach by evaluating evolutionary patterns of morphological integration in head shape for a lineage of Plethodon salamanders, and find significant integration between cranial shape and mandible shape. Finally, computer code written in R for implementing the procedure is provided.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="felice_ecology_2014" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Ecology and Caudal Skeletal Morphology in Birds: The Convergent Evolution of Pygostyle Shape in Underwater Foraging Taxa</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ryan N.

The evolution of this function for the tail contributed to the diversification of birds by allowing them to utilize a wider range of flight behaviors and thus exploit a greater range of ecological niches. The shape of the wings and the tail feathers influence the aerodynamic properties of a bird. Accordingly, taxa that habitually utilize different flight behaviors are characterized by different flight apparatus morphologies. This study explores whether differences in flight behavior are also associated with variation in caudal vertebra and pygostyle morphology. Details of the tail skeleton were characterized in 51 Aequornithes and Charadriiformes species. Free caudal vertebral morphology was measured using linear metrics. Variation in pygostyle morphology was characterized using Elliptical Fourier Analysis, a geometric morphometric method for the analysis of outline shapes. Each taxon was categorized based on flight style (flap, flap-glide, dynamic soar, etc.) and foraging style (aerial, terrestrial, plunge dive, etc.). Phylogenetic MANOVAs and Flexible Discriminant Analyses were used to test whether caudal skeletal morphology can be used to predict flight behavior. Foraging style groups differ significantly in pygostyle shape, and pygostyle shape predicts foraging style with less than 4% misclassification error. Four distinct lineages of underwater foraging birds exhibit an elongate, straight pygostyle, whereas aerial and terrestrial birds are characterized by a short, dorsally deflected pygostyle. Convergent evolution of a common pygostyle phenotype in diving birds suggests that this morphology is related to the mechanical demands of using the tail as a rudder during underwater foraging. Thus, distinct locomotor behaviors influence not only feather attributes but also the underlying caudal skeleton, reinforcing the importance of the entire caudal locomotor module in avian ecological diversification.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="felice_coevolution_2014" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> <p>Coevolution of caudal skeleton and tail feathers in birds</p> </div> <div class="author"> Ryan N.

The tail apparatus consists of a several mobile (free) caudal vertebrae, a terminal skeletal element (the pygostyle), and an articulated fan of tail feathers that may be spread or folded, as well as muscular and ﬁbroadipose structures that facilitate tail movements. Morphological variation in both the tail fan and the caudal skeleton that supports it are well documented. The structure of the tail feathers and the pygostyle each evolve in response to functional demands of differing locomotor behaviors. Here, I test whether the integument and skeleton coevolve in this important locomotor module. I quantiﬁed feather and skeletal morphology in a diverse sample of waterbirds and shorebirds using a combination of linear and geometric morphometrics. Covariation between tail fan shape and skeletal morphology was then tested using phylogenetic comparative methods. Pygostyle shape is found to be a good predictor of tail fan shape (e.g., forked, graduated), supporting the hypothesis that the tail fan and the tail skeleton have coevolved. This statistical relationship is used to reconstruct feather morphology in an exemplar fossil waterbird, Limnofregata azygosternon. Based on pygostyle morphology, this taxon is likely to have exhibited a forked tail fan similar to that of its extant sister clade Fregata, despite differing in inferred ecology and other aspects of skeletal anatomy. These methods may be useful in reconstructing rectricial morphology in other extinct birds and thus assist in characterizing the evolution of ﬂight control surfaces in birds. J.
